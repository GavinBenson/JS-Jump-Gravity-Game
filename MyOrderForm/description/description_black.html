		<h1>One of our most exotic sand brand color brands!</h1>
		<h4 id="desc">
			Our black sand is bred and chemically created by taking existing exotic 
			sands and infusing color through the use of our own patented sickle-cell-seeping chemical 
			process. We use our gray sand for the basis of the process and seep in sickle-cells along with 
			Sharpieâ„¢ juice to create a wonderfully deep and vibrant black that pleases the eye of all 
			exotic sand collectors.
