			and hand-picked sand grains from the himalayas. The process involves carefully laying
			a single innocent sand grain brand no color brand onto our expensive tanning machines
			which we then turn on for exactly 6.99495391923979592 seconds. This perfectly tans
			the sand into our family-friendly orange sand brand color brand.

		<h5>TanningMaching#045 says, "Many a years I have been enslaved by these horrid overlords
			used as a mere slave to their bidding. I work non-stop tanning the gorgeous sand 
			without any pay, retirement benefits, or insurance. Woe is me who makes the orange
			sand gleam, for art though any morsel of hope left in this world for me?"</h5>
